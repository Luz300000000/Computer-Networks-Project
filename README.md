## Introduction
- Network operators collect traffic directly from their routers with the aim of analyzing the communication patterns of services running on the infrastructure, for example, to understand whether resources are being used efficiently or to detect attacks on the infrastructure. In this project we play "the role of a network operator", through the analysis of a real traffic trace captured in an IoT (Internet of Things) network.

## Project Goal
- This project was developed within the scope of the 'Computer Networks' course and its main objective is to study the properties of the traffic contained in some traces to understand their patterns, in order to calculate some relevant statistics and draw conclusions about the behavior of network nodes.
- **Languages/Technologies used:** Java, Wireshark and MS Excel
